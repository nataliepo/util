Getting sloppy with my journal commits.....

SHORT CODING DAY TODAY:
	X make Stylist slurp in a JSON feed specifying objects to present as an alternative to the list that initialize_form_data() builds now.
	X avoid getting too caught up in css details because its a time waster
	
NOTE TO SELF: the last item in a JSON list cannot have a comma.

TO DO TOMORROW:
	* clean up json feed.  
	
	{
        "obj" : {
            "input_id" : "font_family", 
            "label": "Font",
            "type" : "text",
            "value" : "\"Helvetica Neue\", Arial, Verdana",
            "css_class_name": "font-family"
        },
        "section" : "tydget",
        "can_customize" : 0
        
    },

	is sloppy.  should be something like:
	section : [
		{
			obj: {
				label: Font,
				/* -- build this to be section+class_name  
				  id: font-family,
				*/
				value: Helvetica,
				class_name: font-family
				can_customize: 0,
				
			}
		}
	]
