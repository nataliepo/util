* downloaded WP 2.9.2

* had to install php on leopard 
** http://foundationphp.com/tutorials/php_leopard.php was very useful
** once I restarted apache, i was able to run the php files.

* added /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql to my PATH var:
** export PATH=/lots/of/paths:/more/paths:/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql

* then, had to modify the default mysql socket that php looks for!
** http://foolswisdom.com/mac-wordpress-error-establishing-a-database-connection/
** changed 
	;mysql.default_socket = /var/mysql/mysql.sock
to 
	mysql.default_socket = /tmp/mysql.sock
And I was up and running!

* username: admin, pwd: natalie

IDEAS:
* a widget that shows my most recent TypePad activity, just like my Twitter widgetizer
* moving serious nataliepo.typepad.com posts over to my nataliepo.com blog
* making my nataliepo.com serve content directly out of a typepad blog


[2] 02/22/10
* starting in the AM to investigate how the Twitter sidebar widget was created.
* started a github project called 'Tydget' for a Typepad Widget as a sidebar.

* investigating the User definitions in Motion:
** /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/typepadapp-1.0.2-py2.6egg/typepadapp/models/ defines the objects in the Typepad app; Motion extends these models and makes its own template tags from there.
** /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/typepad-1.0-py2.6.egg/typepad/api.py defines how all of the api endpoints are called in Motion.

* back to JSON docs again: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/

LEFT TO DO:
*Having a hard time getting Javascript/JSON/JQuery working in a standard html page.  Should do this in Django, instead.

http://api.typepad.com/users/6p00e5539faa3b8833/events.json?max-results=5 is what I want to work wtih.  http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/request-response/ is probably a good place to start.

PICKING UP AGAIN:
* having fun with Django tonight.  already got a view working!!!

nataliepos XID = 6p00e5539faa3b8833


Found a resource (http://pkarl.com/articles/how-we-built-feed-apart-using-django-twitter-and-f/) that shows how they build a Django aggregator, but i dont understand how Django makes API requests.

OPEN QUESTIONS:

typepad_api_url = 'http://api.typepad.com/users/%s/events.json?max-results=5' % natalies_xid

This pulls all of my events, but this

typepad_api_url = 'http://api.typepad.com/groups/%s/events.json?max-results=5&start-index=1' % mmmeows_group_xid

pulls only 5 events from mmmeow. Why?

This day went to TPM to write the MostRecc plugin to avoid costly sql queries for most recent favorites over thousands of blogs in one category

[8] 2/28/10

Continued TPM work and a good-bye party for Tracie and Wayne. :(

[9] 03/01/10

Tested the MostRecc plugin in TPM's env and deployed in the evening.  

Picked back up on the django work and I have the following problems:
* having a really tough time learning how to include the useful things in the typepadapp (django) like template filters or objects
* it doesn't make sense to go from js -> django -> js again.  should just parse the json directly although it's complicated.  at least django templating is giving me practice and helping me learn the json object formats.

Got the javascript parsing html+js to work!  No Django is involved, but the groups/<xid>.js template is useful for faster css styling since it's not my strong suit.  To pick up where I left off:
	cp django_frontend/another_site.html /Library/WebServer/Documents/
	cp django_frontend/typepad_parsing.js /Library/WebServer/Documents
then view 
	http://localhost/another_site.html 
to make sure the most recent 5 events appear on the page.

AT WORK, I successfully got Tumblelog running on my local machine. It's another application that accesses the TypePad API, but it links to the BlogAPI's instead of the Group API's like Motion does.  Pretty exciting!

LEFT TO DO:
	* clean up the styling of the widget to make it a little bit more presentable
	* replace the (untitled entries) with the entry body truncated
	* create the django wrapper for easy html inserts/badging.

Another day of Javascript + CSS styling, and I'm starting to get somewhere.  

CHALLENGES:
	I'm having a hard time creating JS objects that have a format like this:
	<p>
		<a class="whatever" href="http://profile.typepad.com/nataliepo">nataliepo</> recently posted a photo to <a href="http://www.mmmeow.com">mmmeow</a>
	</p>
	so I keep nesting divs and objects by the appendChild() method.  I though innerHTML() would work but it does not.  
	
LEFT TO DO:
	* continue cleaning up the widget
	* create the django wrapper for easy html inserts but this is still a long ways off.  creating individual html tags via javascript is a real pain in the ass. i wish i could use the django templating.
	* add a basic header and footer
	* figure out how to parse a timestamp of "2010-03-04T02:43:59Z" in javascript using relative dates (ie Posted Yesterday)
	
	
[12] 03/04/10

To avoid yesterday's challenge, I ended up getting tricky with divs and hrefs.  Instead of doing:
	<p>
		<a class="whatever" href="http://profile.typepad.com/nataliepo">nataliepo</a> recently posted a photo
	</p>

I wrapped that naked text in a <a> tag.  I also put it in a <span> in another place.
<p>
	<a class="whatever" href="http://profile.typepad.com/nataliepo">nataliepo</> <a class="whatever-else" href="http://mmmeow.com/post/23423058">recently posted a photo</a>
</p>
	
TODAY I:
	* natalified the style (see screenshot folder in today's commit here: http://github.com/nataliepo/Twidget/commit/2edf4849a669ec4d859c481a33d7c067311aa3b8. yikes!)
	
CHALLENGES:
	* The name, group image, group description, and the root URL of the Motion site isn't in the events.json feed.  
	* I gave up on the timestamp parsing. 
	* I swapped out mmmeow's XID with Avatar's and the widget doesn't work. :( Don't know why yet.
	
STILL NEED TO DO:
	* Figure out why Avatar's XID doesn't work with the group.
	* Avoid hard-coding too many style elements in the Javascript.
	* Style 9-11 on my widget!
