* downloaded WP 2.9.2

* had to install php on leopard 
** http://foundationphp.com/tutorials/php_leopard.php was very useful
** once I restarted apache, i was able to run the php files.

* added /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql to my PATH var:

* then, had to modify the default mysql socket that php looks for!
** http://foolswisdom.com/mac-wordpress-error-establishing-a-database-connection/

to 
	mysql.default_socket = /tmp/mysql.sock
And I was up and running!

* username: admin, pwd: natalie

IDEAS:
* a widget that shows my most recent TypePad activity, just like my Twitter widgetizer
* moving serious nataliepo.typepad.com posts over to my nataliepo.com blog
* making my nataliepo.com serve content directly out of a typepad blog

* starting in the AM to investigate how the Twitter sidebar widget was created.
* started a github project called 'Tydget' for a Typepad Widget as a sidebar.

* investigating the User definitions in Motion:
** /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/typepadapp-1.0.2-py2.6egg/typepadapp/models/ defines the objects in the Typepad app; Motion extends these models and makes its own template tags from there.
** /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/typepad-1.0-py2.6.egg/typepad/api.py defines how all of the api endpoints are called in Motion.

* back to JSON docs again: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/

LEFT TO DO:
*Having a hard time getting Javascript/JSON/JQuery working in a standard html page.  Should do this in Django, instead.

http://api.typepad.com/users/6p00e5539faa3b8833/events.json?max-results=5 is what I want to work wtih.  http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/request-response/ is probably a good place to start.

PICKING UP AGAIN:
* having fun with Django tonight.  already got a view working!!!

This day went to TPM to write the MostRecc plugin to avoid costly sql queries for most recent favorites over thousands of blogs in one category

/***************

Continued TPM work and a good-bye party for Tracie and Wayne. :(

/***************
 * [6] 03/01/10

Tested the MostRecc plugin in TPM's env and deployed in the evening.  

Picked back up on the django work and I have the following problems:
* having a really tough time learning how to include the useful things in the typepadapp (django) like template filters or objects
* it doesn't make sense to go from js -> django -> js again.  should just parse the json directly although it's complicated.  at least django templating is giving me practice and helping me learn the json object formats.

/***************
 * [7] 03/02/10
 ****************/

Got the javascript parsing html+js to work!  No Django is involved, but the groups/<xid>.js template is useful for faster css styling since it's not my strong suit.  To pick up where I left off:
	cp django_frontend/another_site.html /Library/WebServer/Documents/
	cp django_frontend/typepad_parsing.js /Library/WebServer/Documents
then view 
	http://localhost/another_site.html 
to make sure the most recent 5 events appear on the page.

AT WORK, I successfully got Tumblelog running on my local machine. It's another application that accesses the TypePad API, but it links to the BlogAPI's instead of the Group API's like Motion does.  Pretty exciting!

LEFT TO DO:
	* clean up the styling of the widget to make it a little bit more presentable
	* replace the (untitled entries) with the entry body truncated
	* create the django wrapper for easy html inserts/badging.
	
Handy Links:

/***************

Another day of Javascript + CSS styling, and I'm starting to get somewhere.  

CHALLENGES:
	I'm having a hard time creating JS objects that have a format like this:
	<p>
		<a class="whatever" href="http://profile.typepad.com/nataliepo">nataliepo</> recently posted a photo to <a href="http://www.mmmeow.com">mmmeow</a>
	</p>
	so I keep nesting divs and objects by the appendChild() method.  I though innerHTML() would work but it does not.  
	
LEFT TO DO:
	* continue cleaning up the widget
	* create the django wrapper for easy html inserts but this is still a long ways off.  creating individual html tags via javascript is a real pain in the ass. i wish i could use the django templating.
	* add a basic header and footer
	* figure out how to parse a timestamp of "2010-03-04T02:43:59Z" in javascript using relative dates (ie Posted Yesterday)
	
	
/***************
 * [9] 03/04/10
 ****************/

To avoid yesterday's challenge, I ended up getting tricky with divs and hrefs.  Instead of doing:
	<p>
		<a class="whatever" href="http://profile.typepad.com/nataliepo">nataliepo</a> recently posted a photo
	</p>

I wrapped that naked text in a <a> tag.  I also put it in a <span> in another place.
<p>
	<a class="whatever" href="http://profile.typepad.com/nataliepo">nataliepo</> <a class="whatever-else" href="http://mmmeow.com/post/23423058">recently posted a photo</a>
</p>
	
TODAY I:
	* natalified the style (see screenshot folder in today's commit here: http://github.com/nataliepo/Twidget/commit/2edf4849a669ec4d859c481a33d7c067311aa3b8. yikes!)
	
	* fixed my ~/.gitconfig file to use email address npodrazik@sixapart.com rather than npodrazik@gmail.com because my commits weren't being properly attributed to my user :(.  I was seeing things committed by "Natalie Podrazik" and some things committed by "nataliepo" with a link to my github profile.  Hopefully this change will make it 100% consistent from my home laptop from now on.
	
CHALLENGES:
	* The name, group image, group description, and the root URL of the Motion site isn't in the events.json feed.  
	* I gave up on the timestamp parsing. 
	* I swapped out mmmeow's XID with Avatar's and the widget doesn't work. :( Don't know why yet.
	
STILL NEED TO DO:
	* Figure out why Avatar's XID doesn't work with the group.
	* Avoid hard-coding too many style elements in the Javascript.
	* Style 9-11 on my widget!
	
	
/***************
 * [10] 03/05/10
 ****************/

Figured out why the Avatar widget isn't working.  Turns out I had the wrong XID!

* Testing the widget anyway to see what issues crop up, and the first is that unicode chars in the api endpoints aren't treated very nicely.  I think Motion cleans them up when rendered.  See example:

	"displayName" : "Ã€n'driÃ©",

in API endpoint but on the front page of Avatar, that user's display name shows up as:

  	Àn'drié  posted 

and in the source, it looks like:

	<span class="vcard author"><a href="/members/halmsta">Àn&#39;drié</a></span> posted
	
BUT(!!) putting 
	<meta name="http-equiv" content="Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8"/>) 
in the header corrects the problem.  Cool.


* I should put a TypePad logo on everything that I do.

<< Weird Errors >>
100s of JS errors on every Motion site:
document.all.tags is not a function
	http://www.iconico.com/CSSScrollbar/CSS.js
	var objColl = document.all.tags('Input'); 
	Line 45
But I cleared my cookies and restarted FF and they went away.  Weird.

* I need to wrap up for the evening since I just spent 20min debugging and it was because I defined a function twice.

CHALLENGES:
	* Hard to find a Motion group's XID.  Should this be publicly available?

STILL NEED TO DO:
	* Get the favorite stars appearing on the site like the comment bubbles are
	* style 9-11 (floating content over images, yuck!)
	* put a "powered by typepad" footer on everything
	* start to toy around with the django interface to pick colors and background
	** abstract out current code into regular html
	
	
/***************
 * [11] 03/06/10

Today I'd like to put Tydget in a place where a designer can ACTUALLY HELP IT.  
Goals:
 X add a footer div that links to www.typepad.com for the Powered By logo
 X name the widget elements consistently instead of erratically!
    This is super important because the local css elements clash with the site's defined elements.  I'm going to prepend all classes and id's with "tydget-" for clarity.
 O clean up the sloppy css examples
    I need to spend less time mucking in css because it's a huge timesuck.  The important thing is to build out the essential HTML elements with sane class labels so somebody else can make it look good. :)
    
BUGS:
    X nywbc has a user with a blank display name.  Fixed it to return "A Member" when no actor.displayName.
    _ i have two divs with id="tydget"!  
    
NOTES:
    Put the NYWBC on nataliepo.com as a test: http://www.nataliepo.com/nywbc.html .  Some of the html elements were overriden (including link rollover on the title--it's bright pink!).  But it works.
    Also put it on http://nataliepo.typepad.com/ .


CHALLENGES:
    * it's hard to specify how many characters should appear in the div because the # of lines is dependent on the styled fontsize.  Maybe I should just stick to the Twitter standard of 140max (username + action + object + title_str), or exclude username from that requirement?
    
LEFT TO DO:
    X get some raw HTML to work with
    X start the django color picker interface. (wasted too much time on css details today to work on that.)

-- round 2

* I always forget how to update my $PATH environment variable.  it's export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin/ for mysql.
 
IDEA: would be cool to implement an ajax chat using typepad auth: http://pythonhaven.wordpress.com/tag/django/

Attempting to implement a simple color picker on django based on this reference: http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/1261/ ...

-- made really good progress on the color picker.  even made some custom classes in django to help with those efforts!

CHALLENGES:
    - I don't know how to make a custom template tag.
    
LEFT TO DO:
    X further the style picker doohickey
    _ get a designer to look over html to get ideas for class elements 
    _ try to make a preview?
    X Split these projects into two separate things.  Style911 should be its own github proj, although its being used to generate Tydget style elements.
    
/***************
 * [12] 03/07/10
 ****************/
IDEAS FOR TODAY:
* Separate Tydget from the Style911 project (and think of a less silly name)
* Make a mode of Tydget that just echoes a plain html example.  This is mondo useful for previews in Style911 and actual design advice as to which HTML elements I should change.

* Ugh! Using JS to appendChild and modify elements is such a pain in the ass. I tried to just set the innerHTML of the div id=tydget and that works SO MUCH EASIER.  Never going back to that appendChild garbage.
** even a simplified way:
function outer_div_setup(obj) {
    
    return '<div id="tydget">  \n' +    
'   <div id="tydget" class="tydget"> \n' + 
'       <div id="tydget-body" class="tydget-body">  \n' +
'           <div class="tydget-header-div"> \n' + 
'               <div class="tydget-header-precursor"> \n' + 
'                   recently on \n' + 
'               </div>\n' + 
'               <a class="tydget-header-title" href="' + 
get_site_url(obj.permalinkUrl) + 
'">' + 
get_site_name(obj.permalinkUrl) + 
'</a> \n' +
'           </div>  \n';
    
}

Doesn't work well for looping.  Trying this out in django now.
* This has to be in JS, so Django doesn't really solve the problem.   The above format is the best I can get for now. :(  Might write another service that can just split out the HTML produced to help with the debugging, but I don't have high hopes for super clean js code.

CHALLENGE:
* There isn't a motion-site-specific profile URL in the events.json feed -- just a link for the universal TypePad profile

PROGRESS:
    Cleaned up much of the Tydget directory and wrote concise directions.  Split out the front-end styler as a new github project ('Stylist'). 

TO DO:
    _ make Stylist consume a settings file with predefined html elements and the type of things that can be styled.  It's not useful to hard code just the elements that Tydget will need, especially because I expect them to change.
    _ use one of the Tydget examples for critical elements
    _ also enable default style elements (sometimes elements should always have padding and margins and users shouldn't have to specify that, etc)


/***************
 * [13] 03/08/10

Getting sloppy with my journal commits.....

SHORT CODING DAY TODAY:
	X make Stylist slurp in a JSON feed specifying objects to present as an alternative to the list that initialize_form_data() builds now.
	X avoid getting too caught up in css details because its a time waster

NOTE TO SELF: the last item in a JSON list cannot have a comma.

TO DO TOMORROW:
	* clean up json feed.  

	{
        "obj" : {
            "input_id" : "font_family", 
            "label": "Font",
            "type" : "text",
            "value" : "\"Helvetica Neue\", Arial, Verdana",
            "css_class_name": "font-family"
        },
        "section" : "tydget",
        "can_customize" : 0

    },

	is sloppy.  should be something like:
	section : [
		{
			obj: {
				label: Font,
				/* -- build this to be section+class_name  
				  id: font-family,
				*/
				value: Helvetica,
				class_name: font-family
				can_customize: 0,

			}
		}
	]

Sat with @liz tonight and she worked through some css for a vanilla Tydget example!  yey!  Now:
  _ using her css as an example input
  _ cleaning up the json input for the feed

BUGS:
    _ !important in css is not respected. may need to flag it as another field.
    _ when can_customize=0, the <div class="hidden" preserves line height instead of just appearing without a display. all items are set to can_customize=1.
    _ colors like #aaa are not appearing as color pickers -- text only. i think its something wrong with the spaces in those class names breaking in the json picker, ex: "tydget-fav-div a" which generates  $('#tydget-fav-div a-color').colorPicker(); .
    _ i defined a new variable in the TydgetField object in models.py (self.element) in the constructor, but I didn't declare him in the model itself.  Wonder if that will be a problem soon?

   font-family: 13px;
   color: 13px;
   width: 13px;
